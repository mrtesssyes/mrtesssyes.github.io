SSTV Web Emulator

This is a browser-only, educational SSTV (Slow Scan TV) emulator. It encodes images to audio and performs a very simple decoding of audio back into a grayscale image. It is intentionally simplified and does NOT implement full SSTV protocols. 

Important: This project does NOT connect to radio hardware and must not be used to transmit on-air unless you have the required licences and comply with local regulations.
